Is the Mormon Church Sexist ?
=============================

Yes, it is. *(And not in a good way for those saying having specific and limiting gender roles is positive...)*

As I've reaserch on the reasons why members leave the Church and on the perceived value of these reasons, I've notices sexism is often belittled as a poor argument. Many exmormon (not all, which is great) would say the true *noble* reasons to leave are the questionable history of the Church, Joseph Smith's unprophetic tendencies, the Book of Abraham translation, etc. God forbid the poor treatment of women to be included! 

I'm not quite sure what are the reasons for that. Is it because they refuse to admit that they were part of the injustice? Is it because they still have engrained that women are too emotional to have rational arguments? Is it because they liked having specific gender roles? I don't  know...

To counter the denigration and in response to the very few ressources I could personnaly find about sexism on the Internet, I've decided to build a website encompassing as many facts about the history of Church sexism as I could find.

_I'm doing this part time with university dumping me work every other minute_ and _English isn't my main language_ and _I can't really work if my siblings or my parents are around_ and _I've never made a website, so **this might take a while.**_

### Where is the website ?
